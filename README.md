The IP3-Ca2+ Crosscoupling Model (ICC) is reviewed by Meyer and Stryer in
1991, originally from Meyer and Stryer, 1988. PMID -
[2455890](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2455890) Parameters refer to
figures 5 and 6 of the article which were reproduced by using Copasi 4.5
(Build 30). Species CaI and IP3 are buffered to 1% and 50% percent,
respectively.
